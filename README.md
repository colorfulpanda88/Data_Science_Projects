### 1. [Analyzing the Performance of Football Teams](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Analysing_the_performance_of_football_teams.ipynb)
Analysed historical data about football teams which have participated in the the La Liga Cup and calculated various metrics which can be used as indicators of success for teams in the tournament.
__Skills Used__
  1. Statistics
  2. Python
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 2. [Predicting Average Air Fares](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Predicting_average_air_fares.ipynb)
Used exploratory data analysis on Airfare data for the US market. Built a model in order to predict average airfares and checked for problems like multicollinearity and took appropriate measures to ensure model performance.
__Skills Used__
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  2. Multiple Regression
  3. Hypothesis Testing

### 3. [Classify Weed from Plant Seedlings](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Classify_Weed_from_Plant_Seedlings.ipynb)
This project involved the identification of weed type from given plant/crop seedlings. The dataset contains images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages. Convolution Neural network with multiple layers was used and implemented using Keras API.
__Skills Used__
  1. Convolution Neural Network
  2. Keras
  3. Tensr Flow
  
### 4. [Classifying Silhouettes of Vehicles](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Classifying_silhouettes_of_vehicles.ipynb)
Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification
__Skills Used__
  1. Support Vector Machines
  2. Principal Component Analysis

### 5. [Clustering Cars based on Attributes](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Clustering_cars_based_on_attributes.ipynb)
Analysed cars dataset and performed exploratory data analysis and then categorised them using K means clustering. Used linear regression on the different clusters and estimated coefficients.
__Skills Used__
  1. K means clustering
  2. Hierarchical clustering
  3. Linear Regression
  
### 6. [Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease using Random Forests](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Diagnosing_Parkinson's_disease_using_Random_Forests.ipynb)
This Project involved using classification algorithms and ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction
__Skills Used__
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Decision Trees
  
### 7. [Health Information to make decisions for Insurance Business](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Health_information_to_make_decisions_for_insurance_business.ipynb)
This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, BMI, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.
__Skils Used__
  1. Hypothesis Testing
  2. Data Visualization
  3. Statistical Inference
  
### 8. [Identifying Potential Customers for Loans](https://github.com/colorfulpanda88/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Academic_Projects/Identifying_potential_customers_for_loans.ipynb)
Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one.
